See Attachments in action! This demo shows how to process various file types and extract content for LLM use.

![Demo](https://github.com/MaximeRivest/attachments/raw/main/demo_full.gif)

```{note}
The full demo video is also available as an MP4: [demo.mp4](https://github.com/MaximeRivest/attachments/raw/main/demo.mp4)
```

## What you'll see in the demo:

- **PDF processing**: Extract text and images from PDF documents
- **PowerPoint slides**: Process PPTX files with slide-specific extraction
- **Web scraping**: Use CSS selectors to extract specific content from web pages
- **Image processing**: Handle various image formats with transformations
- **Project analysis**: Generate detailed file reports with character and line counts
- **LLM integration**: Send processed content directly to OpenAI and Claude APIs

## Try it yourself:

```python
from attachments import Attachments

# Process the same files shown in the demo
pdf = Attachments("https://github.com/MaximeRivest/attachments/raw/main/src/attachments/data/sample.pdf")
pptx = Attachments("https://github.com/MaximeRivest/attachments/raw/main/src/attachments/data/sample_multipage.pptx[3-5]")

print(f"PDF text length: {len(str(pdf))}")
print(f"PPTX images extracted: {len(pptx.images)}")

# Generate a detailed project report
report = Attachments("src/[mode:report][files:true][force:true]")
print("ðŸ“Š Project Analysis:")
print(report.text)
```
