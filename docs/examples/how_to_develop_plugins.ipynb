    "# How to develop plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will walk you through creating your own plugins for the `attachments` library. Plugins allow you to extend the library's functionality by adding support for new file types, transformations, rendering methods, or an entirely new way to package outputs for different APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plugin Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The `attachments` library supports several types of plugins, each serving a distinct purpose in the processing pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`Loader`**: Responsible for taking a path (file path or URL) and loading its raw content into a Python object. For example, a `PDFLoader` might take \"my_document.pdf\" and return a `pypdf.PdfReader` object.\n",
    "*   **`Renderer`**: Takes a Python object (usually the output of a `Loader` or `Transform`) and converts it into a specific content type. There are different kinds of renderers:\n",
    "    *   `renderer_text`: Produces a string (e.g., extracting text from a PDF object).\n",
    "    *   `renderer_image`: Produces a list of base64 encoded image strings.\n",
    "    *   `renderer_audio`: Produces a list of base64 encoded audio strings.\n",
    "*   **`Transform`**: Modifies an object in place or functionally. Transforms are applied after loading and before rendering. They are triggered by tokens in the attachment string, like `photo.jpg[rotate:90]`. The `Rotate` transform is an example.\n",
    "*   **`Deliverer`**: Packages the final text, images, and audio content into the specific format expected by a downstream API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the base classes for these in `src/attachments/core.py`: `Loader`, `Renderer`, `Transform`, and `Deliverer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating and Registering a Plugin\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a simple `Renderer` that takes a string and \"renders\" it by converting it to uppercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# my_uppercase_renderer.py\n",
    "from attachments.plugin_api import register_plugin\n",
    "from attachments.core import Renderer # Import the base class\n",
    "from typing import Any, Dict\n",
    "\n",
    "@register_plugin(kind=\"renderer_text\", priority=50) # Higher priority means it's tried sooner\n",
    "class UppercaseTextRenderer(Renderer):\n",
    "    content_type = \"text\"  # This renderer produces text\n",
    "\n",
    "    def match(self, obj: Any) -> bool:\n",
    "        # This renderer will only operate on string objects\n",
    "        return isinstance(obj, str)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def render(self, obj: Any, meta: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:\n",
    "        # The actual rendering logic\n",
    "        if isinstance(obj, str):\n",
    "            return obj.upper()\n",
    "        return \"\" # Should ideally not be reached if match() is specific enough\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "*   **Base Class**: Your plugin should inherit from one of the base classes (`Loader`, `Renderer`, `Transform`, `Deliverer`).\n",
    "*   **`@register_plugin`**: This decorator from `attachments.plugin_api` is crucial.\n",
    "    *   `kind`: Specifies the type of plugin. For our `UppercaseTextRenderer`, it's `\"renderer_text\"`. Other kinds include `\"loader\"`, `\"renderer_image\"`, `\"transform\"`, etc.\n",
    "    *   `priority`: An integer that determines the order in which plugins of the same kind are tried. Higher numbers are tried first. The default is 100.\n",
    "*   **Required Methods**:\n",
    "    *   `Loader`: `match(cls, path: str)` and `load(self, path: str)`.\n",
    "    *   `Renderer`: `content_type` (class attribute), `match(self, obj: Any)`, and `render(self, obj: Any, meta: Dict[str, Any])`.\n",
    "    *   `Transform`: `name` (class attribute for the DSL token) and `apply(self, obj: Any, arg: str | None)`.\n",
    "    *   `Deliverer`: `name` (class attribute) and `package(self, text, images, audio, prompt)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling Optional Dependencies with `@requires`\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, plugins will depend on external libraries (e.g., `Pillow` for image processing, `pytesseract` for OCR). If a user doesn't have these libraries installed, your plugin shouldn't cause the entire `attachments` library to fail. The `@requires` decorator handles this gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# my_ocr_renderer.py\n",
    "from attachments.plugin_api import register_plugin, requires\n",
    "from attachments.core import Renderer\n",
    "from typing import Any, Dict\n",
    "\n",
    "# This plugin requires 'pytesseract' and 'PIL' (Pillow)\n",
    "@register_plugin(\"renderer_text\", priority=60)\n",
    "@requires(\"pytesseract\", \"PIL\", pip_names={\"PIL\": \"Pillow\", \"pytesseract\": \"pytesseract\"})\n",
    "class AdvancedImageOCR(Renderer):\n",
    "    content_type = \"text\"\n",
    "    # For selftest (see below)\n",
    "    _sample_obj = \"path/to/dummy_image.png\" # Path to a sample image for testing, or a PIL.Image object\n",
    "\n",
    "    def match(self, obj: Any) -> bool:\n",
    "        # This would typically check if obj is a PIL Image or something similar\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            from PIL import Image\n",
    "            return isinstance(obj, Image.Image)\n",
    "        except ImportError:\n",
    "            return False # If PIL isn't even there, it can't match\n",
    "\n",
    "    def render(self, obj: Any, meta: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:\n",
    "        import pytesseract # Import here, as @requires ensures it's available\n",
    "        from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "        if not isinstance(obj, Image.Image):\n",
    "            return \"\"\n",
    "        return pytesseract.image_to_string(obj)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### How `@requires` Works:\n",
    "*   It checks if all listed modules can be imported.\n",
    "*   If any module is missing, the plugin class is replaced by a `MissingDependencyProxy`.\n",
    "*   The `@register_plugin` decorator will then silently skip registering this proxy.\n",
    "*   A warning is logged indicating which plugin was disabled and why (e.g., \"Module 'pytesseract' not found. Try `pip install pytesseract`.\").\n",
    "*   `pip_names`: This dictionary helps provide correct installation instructions if the PyPI package name differs from the import module name (e.g., module `PIL` is installed via `pip install Pillow`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagnostics and `@requires`\n",
    "The diagnostics layer we recently added ties into this. If a plugin is skipped due to missing dependencies, and an `Attachment` object fails to render a certain content type (e.g., \"image\") because all relevant renderers were disabled, the `attachment.debug()` method will provide a clear explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from attachments import Attachment\n",
    "# Assume MyImageSnapshotRenderer requires 'playwright' but it's not installed.\n",
    "# a = Attachment(\"https://example.com[snapshot:true]\") # if snapshot was a transform leading to a webpage object\n",
    "# If a webpage object was loaded, but the snapshot renderer (image) was disabled:\n",
    "# print(a.debug())\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example output from `a.debug()`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Attachment: https://example.com\n",
    "  No renderer produced image. Tried:\n",
    "    ❌ MyImageSnapshotRenderer  (Module 'playwright' not found. Try `pip install playwright`.)\n",
    "    ❌ SomeOtherImageRenderer (predicate_mismatch)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This tells the user exactly why they didn't get an image and how to fix it. Your plugin's `_attachments_disabled_msg` (set by `@requires`) becomes part of this diagnostic output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plugin Quality: `PluginContract` and `selftest`\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure plugins are well-behaved and follow basic expectations, the library includes a `PluginContract` (in `src/attachments/testing.py`). While not strictly enforced for external plugins automatically, it's good practice for your plugin to be compatible with its conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many built-in plugins implement a `selftest(self, tmp_path)` method. This method is used by `pytest` (see `tests/test_all_plugins_contract.py`) to perform basic checks:\n",
    "*   **Loaders**: Can it `match` and `load` its `_sample_path` (an extension string like \"pdf\", \"csv\", for which `_create_sample_file_for_selftest` in `testing.py` will create a dummy file)?\n",
    "*   **Renderers**: Can it `match` and `render` its `_sample_obj` (a dummy Python object it expects)? Does the output type match its `content_type`?\n",
    "*   **Transforms**: Can it `apply` to its `_sample_obj`?\n",
    "*   **Deliverers**: Can it `package` various combinations of text, images, and audio?\n",
    "\n",
    "If your plugin uses `@requires`, the `selftest` will be automatically skipped if dependencies are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider adding `_sample_path` (for loaders, a string like \"txt\", \"myext\") or `_sample_obj` (for renderers/transforms, an actual minimal Python object) to your plugin class to facilitate testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# my_custom_loader.py\n",
    "from attachments.plugin_api import register_plugin, requires\n",
    "from attachments.core import Loader\n",
    "from attachments.testing import PluginContract # Can inherit for selftest\n",
    "from typing import Any\n",
    "\n",
    "@register_plugin(\"loader\", priority=10)\n",
    "class MyCustomFormatLoader(Loader, PluginContract): # Inherit PluginContract\n",
    "    _sample_path = \"myext\" # The file extension this loader handles\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def match(cls, path: str) -> bool:\n",
    "        return path.endswith(\".myext\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def load(self, path: str) -> Any:\n",
    "        # In a real scenario, you'd read the file content\n",
    "        with open(path, 'r') as f:\n",
    "            content = f.read()\n",
    "        return {\"path\": path, \"content\": content, \"type\": \"MyCustomObject\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# To make its selftest work, you might need to add \"myext\" handling to\n",
    "# _create_sample_file_for_selftest in src/attachments/testing.py,\n",
    "# or provide a _sample_obj if it made more sense for your loader's selftest.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plugin Discovery: `ATTACHMENTS_PLUGIN_PATH`\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, `attachments` discovers plugins within its own `attachments.plugins` directory. To load plugins from other locations (e.g., from your own project or a separate package):\n",
    "1.  Place your plugin Python file (e.g., `my_cool_plugin.py`) in a directory.\n",
    "2.  Set the environment variable `ATTACHMENTS_PLUGIN_PATH` to the absolute path of this directory (or the specific file).\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    export ATTACHMENTS_PLUGIN_PATH=/path/to/my/plugins_directory\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Or, you can point to multiple paths separated by `os.pathsep` (e.g., `:` on Linux/macOS, `;` on Windows).\n",
    "3.  When `import attachments` is next executed, it will attempt to discover and register plugins from this path.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mechanism allows for easy extensibility without modifying the core `attachments` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Running the Uppercase Renderer\n",
    "If you save the `my_uppercase_renderer.py` from above and set `ATTACHMENTS_PLUGIN_PATH` to its directory:\n",
