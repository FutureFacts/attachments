The [README.md](mdc:README.md) is the ground truth  on the interface we aim to implement and [architecture.md](mdc:docs/architecture.md) is a great place for a height level understandings of the library archeticture.

use uv and .venv (my uv virtual environment).

ALWAYS USE :    uv run python ....py

### Content Fidelity First
**Users input is sacred.** Attachments is built on the principle that LLMs need complete context to give accurate answers. We preserve 100% of users content by default:

- **No silent truncations** – If content is limited, it's because users explicitly requested it
- **No arbitrary limits** – We don't decide what's "too much" content for user's use case  
- **Full extraction** – When user ask for a PDF, they get the whole PDF (all pages, all text, all images)


If you run uv and python in cursor inproperly:

THIS IS WRONG:
source .venv/bin/activate && python docs/scripts/how_to_load_and_morph.py


YOU GET ISSUES AROUND THOSE THINGS:
env | grep -i cursor

unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH

python -c "import sys; print('sys.executable:', sys.executable); print('sys.base_executable:', sys.base_executable)"


python3 -c "import sys; print('sys.executable:', sys.executable)"
